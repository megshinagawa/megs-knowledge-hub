# Meg's Knowledge Hub

This is a public knowledge hub curated by [@megshinagawa](https://github.com/megshinagawa) using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## A Note from the Author

This project is mainly for my *own* sanity because my ADHD brain forgets where I put stuff (including information) so I'm making it publicly accessible. But if you're interested in what I'm learning about and thinking about, feel free to check it out!

## Structure

- `00_dailies`: notepad to capture everything
- `01_notes`: refined notes on learnings
- `02_resources`: reference materials
- `03_output`: things written by [@megshinagawa](https://github.com/megshinagawa)
