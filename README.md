# Meg's Knowledge Hub

This is a public knowledge hub curated by [@megshinagawa](https://github.com/megshinagawa) using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## A Note from the Author

This project is mainly for my *own* sanity because my ADHD brain forgets where I put stuff (including information) so I'm making it publicly accessible. But if you're interested in what I'm learning about and thinking about, feel free to check it out!

## Structure

- `00_inbox/`: temporary storage for new content before processing
- `01_dailies/`: daily notes organized by year and month
- `02_notes/`: refined notes on learnings and concepts
- `03_outputs/`: things written by [@megshinagawa](https://github.com/megshinagawa)
- `04_tags/`: tag definitions and metadata
- `98_templates/`: templates for creating new notes, dailies, and tags
