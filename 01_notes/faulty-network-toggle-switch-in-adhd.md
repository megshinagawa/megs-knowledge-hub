# FAULTY NETWORK TOGGLE SWITCH IN ADHD

#ADHD #psychology 

For neurotypical people, the brain toggles between the default mode network (DMN) and the task positive network (TPN). But in ADHD brains, the toggle switch between the two is faulty. This means that both the DMN and the TPN are constantly competing with each other for control. 

> In ADHD, therefore, the DMN competes with the TPN, which in most people it does not do. -- ADHD 2.0

> If there is one takeaway in distilling down the complexity of the DMN and the TPN, it boils down to the fact that the toggle switches between them are off in those with ADHD. -- ADHD 2.0

## DEFAULT MODE NETWORK

One of the two brain networks that allows for creative thinking. Neurotypical people can switch to the DMN periodically to rest. But people with ADHD often get stuck in the DMN. 

> The DMN allows for expansive, imaginative and creative thinking. -- ADHD 2.0

## TASK POSITIVE NETWORK

One of the two brain networks that's responsible for getting things done. In this state you're focused on only the task at hand. 

> The connectme that lights up when you're engaged in a task is called task-positive network, or TNP. -- ADHD 2.0
