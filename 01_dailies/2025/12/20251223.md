- Working tips
	- Create DFDs within the meeting - ie: don't take it home as homework 


## Business Process Flowchart

- Also known as:
	- Workflow Diagram
	- Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Diagram

### How to draw a BPF

1. Define the goal and scope: Where does the process start and end?
2. Identify the "actors": list the departments or roles involved
3. List the steps (drafting): Write down the action in order to get the sequence correct
4. Place the symbols: Convert your list into a visual chart using standard symbols
5. Review: Show it to someone who can verify your work and get feedback

### Common symbols 

- Oval (terminator): Used to denote start and end points
- Rectangle (process): Represents specific task or action
- Diamond (decision): Use when flow can go two ways
- Swimlanes (lines): divide the chart into rows or columns to show who is responsible for which step

## Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

- ER diagrams are specialized flowcharts that illustrate how "entities" relate to each other within a system

### How to draw an ER diagram

1. Identify your entities
	- ==Entities==: Core objects that need to be tracked within a system
		- Denoted by rectangle
		- Examples: Customer, Order, Product, Employee
	- ==Weak Entities==: Objects that cannot exist without a parent entity
		- Denoted by double rectangle
		- Example: Order Item cannot exist without Order
2. Add attributes
	- ==Attributes==: Specific data points that describe each entity
	- ==Primary Key==: The most important attribute that uniquely identifies each record
		- Denoted with underline
		- Example: CustomerID
	- ==Multivalued Attributes==: Entities that can have more than one value for a category
		- Denoted by double oval
		- Example: A student can have multiple Subjects
	- ==Derived Attributes==: Values calculated from other data
		- Denoted by dashed oval
		- Example: Age can be derived from Date of Birth
3. Establish relationships
	- Define how your entities interact with each other
		- Denoted by diamond
	- Label the connection with a verb
		- Example: Customer **places** Order
	- Recursive Relationship: If an entity relates to itself, the line loops back to the same rectangle
		- Example: Employee **manages** another Employee
4. Define cardinality
	- Specifies how many instances of one entity are associated with another
	- Common denotations:
		- Numerical (Chen Notation): Placing "1" and "N" or "M" next to entities to show relationships like 1:N (one to many)
		- Crow's Foot Notation: A visual style where a three-pronged "crow's foot" at the end of a line indicates "many"
