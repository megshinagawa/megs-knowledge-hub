# BINARY LARGE OBJECT

A Binary Large Object, also referred to as a Blob, is a type of unstructured data that is optimized for data survival.

- Data type: Unstructured data (ie: no schema)
- Structure: Flat namespace (ie: no complex indexing for querying contents)
- Purpose: Optimized for high read/write throughput of large objects and guarantees data survival
