# BUSINESS PROCESS FLOWCHART

- Also known as:
	- Workflow Diagram
	- Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Diagram

## How to Draw

1. Define the goal and scope: Where does the process start and end?
2. Identify the "actors": list the departments or roles involved
3. List the steps (drafting): Write down the action in order to get the sequence correct
4. Place the symbols: Convert your list into a visual chart using standard symbols
5. Review: Show it to someone who can verify your work and get feedback

## Symbols

- Oval (terminator): Used to denote start and end points
- Rectangle (process): Represents specific task or action
- Diamond (decision): Use when flow can go two ways
- Swimlanes (lines): divide the chart into rows or columns to show who is responsible for which step

## Example: Cafe
